<h3>Steps required to take Mateme (as Mike delivered by Mike on Jun 4) and get
it deployed to Queens.</h3>

<h2>1. Add in the encounters and observation</h2> The system has an encounter
selection screen at the following URL: <code> /encounter_types/ </code>

We need to add the required encounters:

<li> Initial Visit
<li> Enter Lab data
<li> Referral
<li> DMHT: Eyes 
<li> DMHT: Renal 
<li> DMHT: Cardiovascular 
<li> DMHT: Neurologic
<li> Other tests (foot, urine... other stuff)
<li> 

This will require us creating new encounter types of the above name. We create
new encounter types by adding them to the appropriate fixture file.

For each encounter we need to add a template to the app/views/encounters. This
will be simple touchscreen toolkit stuff. Note that Jeff has put a lot of work
into eliminating the need for custom CSS on touchscreen toolkit pages. Use this
new approach to avoid lots of pain!!

Each question that is asked in the template will need to have a concept that
matches each question that we are asking. Look in db/data/defaults to see if
there are concepts that already exist that meet our needs.

If we need to create new concepts, then we do it in the .yml fixtures. This
requires us to add a concept name entry and a corresponding concept.

Fixtures are found in two places:

<code> 
/test/fixtures
/db/data/defaults
</code>

For our testing environment we load the test/fixtures with: 
<code> rake openmrs:bootstrap:load:samples </code>

Testing fixtures should only contain the bare minimum data needed for testing.

For deployment we load /db/data/defaults fixtures with: 
<code> rake openmrs:bootstrap:load:defaults </code>

Default fixtures will include all data required for a deployment. If there are
site specific fixtures (for users, for example) then create a new directory
under /db/ (see nno for example)

<h2>2. Add /demographic/ URL to QECH ART, MPC, LH, Salima, Dedza, CMERD
sites.</h2>

Mateme allows someone to scan a barcode that has been created from
any site. If a barcode is scanned and a patient doesn't match it in the local
database it will go out and check every other Baobab site by doing the
following request:

<code> GET /demographics/?person[patient][identifiers]["Nationalid"]=P12321121213 </code>

The result of this will be a JSON object that represents the matched patient:
(note this is in ruby format for readability)

<code> 

{ "person" => {
        "date_changed"=>"Sat Jan 01 00:00:00 +0200 2000",
        "gender" => "M",
        "birth_year" => 1982,
        "birth_month" => 6,
        "birth_day" => 9,
        "names" => {
          "given_name" => "Evan",
          "family_name" => "Waters",
          "family_name2" => ""
        },
        "addresses" => {
          "county_district" => "",
          "city_village" => "Katoleza"
        },
        "patient" => {
          "identifiers" => {
            "National id" => "P1701210013",
            "ARV Number" => "ARV-311",
            "Pre ART Number" => "PART-311",
          }
        }
      }}
</code>

This hash can then be passed to the POST /create/ URL to create a patient
(passing a ruby object to a POST can be done by calling to_param on the hash).
The params passed use the same format and the same URL that is used when we
create a patient from the normal registration form. Note that the same format
is used in the GET request to /demographics.

Add created_at and updated_at to demographic hash. - DONE BY Kondwani

Handle voided patients

What happens when we submit to create a patient that already exists. We should
check and see if the national id already exists before we create the person.

TEST thoroughly!! Use fakeweb to help. <a

<h2>3. Merge in mateme's touchscreen user admin code</h2> This fork of mateme is
missing the ability to create users, reset passwords, etc. It assumes that you
will use the keyboard based interface OpenMRS interface. We almost certainly
want Oliver's user admin code. This is not high priority as user management can
be done via the console if needed by Baobab.

<h2>4. Create the graphs</h2> Use flot to create some simple graphs that appear on
the dashboard. Soyapi of Ushahidi fame is the expert. Note that we will be
deploying on J2's - this means we have more room and are not so worried about
slow rendering.

<h2>5. Setup the prescription module</h2> There is a prescription module included.
For it to be useful it will need drugs to be added and it will need to be
discussed with clinicians to make sure that it addresses their needs. I am not
sure how to manage available drugs. It might be done at the script/console
level or perhaps with the OpenMRS interface.

<h2>6. Setup passwordless (key based) ssh login between sites</h2> 
<h2>7. Figure out how to deploy with capistrano</h2>
<h2>8. Define the reports</h2>
Create a mastercard
Create a cohort

<h2>9. Don't deploy without control over the paper system</h2>
Lets use labels in the register. Don't let us get in the position where we are being evaluated against a fragile paper system.
<h2>10. Create specification document from cucumber stories</h2>
run script to generate the features specification document
<code>
./support/features_to_doc.rb > features.html
</code>
